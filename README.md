# Twitch Getting Started with Chatbots & IRC
=================

## Chatbot Overview

Twitch offers an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) interface for chat functionality. Chatbots allow you to programmatically interact with a Twitch chat feed using IRC standards; the bot connects to the Twitch IRC network as a client to perform these actions.This guide presents an easy bot example to get you started.

### Building the Bot

Weâ€™ll build a simple chatbot that responds in chat when someone types `!dice`. (This is known as a chatbot command.) When triggered, it randomly generates a number between 1-6. We run the fully-functioning chatbot on this Glitch,  as well as show you how to run locally on our [Developer Docs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/).

## Basic Chatbot

We will build a simple bot that uses the`!echo` command. When triggered, it will repeat and display the user's message. We will use [tmi.js](https://docs.tmijs.org/) which is a community driven wrapper around Twitch's API.

### Credentials

You will need:

* `BOT_USERNAME` - Your Twitch account's username. Note: If you aren't comfortable granting API access to your primary account, you can create an additional Twitch account to act as your bot.
* `OAUTH_TOKEN` - Generated using an Implicit grant flow. Use this [community tool](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
* `CHANNEL_NAME` - The Twitch channel name where you want to run the bot.  

### Building the bot


1. To start with this template, click the Remix button in the upper right. 

2. Glitch automatically installs Node, Express and Tmi.js for us.

3. Add the three environmental vars in our [`.env`](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitch-chatbot?path=.env:1:0) file.

4. View the code in `bot.js`. 

5. Your chatbot is ready to run! Glitch automatically deploys & runs each version. View the status button to ensure there are no errors. 

6. Try the chatbot! Interact with your channel (twitch.tv/<CHANNEL_NAME>) by trying  the `!echo` command. 

**Note**: This bot connects to the IRC network as a client and isn't designed to respond over HTTP. If you click "Show Live" you will see a simple "Hello World"
